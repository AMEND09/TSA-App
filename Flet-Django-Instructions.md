You are absolutely right. Using `flet-django` is a completely different (and often simpler) paradigm than a separate REST API. My apologies for providing the wrong architecture. `flet-django` embeds the Flet application directly into a Django view, creating a tightly integrated, monolithic web app.

This approach is excellent because it allows you to leverage Django's powerful features like its ORM, authentication, and session management *directly* within your Flet app.

Here is the correct, comprehensive `README.md` file explaining how to structure your project, handle routing, and manage data using the `flet-django` library.

# Integrating Your App with `flet-django`

This guide explains how to integrate your Flet UI with a Django backend using the `flet-django` library. This approach creates a single, unified application where Flet is rendered inside a Django view, giving it direct access to Django's authentication and data.

This is different from a REST API. Instead of two separate servers, you will run **only one Django server**.

## Core Concept: The `FletView`

The `flet-django` library provides a special Django view called `FletView`. When a user navigates to a URL connected to this view, Django will:
1.  Render a basic HTML page.
2.  Establish a WebSocket connection.
3.  Run your Flet app's `main` function on the server for that specific user.
4.  Render and control the Flet UI in the user's browser over the WebSocket.

The most powerful feature is that the Django `request` object (which contains the logged-in user, session data, etc.) is passed directly into your Flet app's `main` function.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install django flet-django
```

## Step 1: Project Structure and Setup

First, let's structure your Django project correctly.

1.  **Create the Django Project and App**
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject tsa_project
    cd tsa_project
    python manage.py startapp tsa_app
    ```

2.  **Place Your Flet Code**
    Move your complete Flet application code into a new file inside your Django app: `tsa_app/flet_app.py`.

3.  **Configure `settings.py`**
    Open `tsa_project/settings.py` and make these changes:

    ```python
    # tsa_project/settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',

        # Add your app and flet_django
        'tsa_app',
        'flet_django',
    ]

    # Add at the bottom of the file
    LOGIN_URL = '/login/'
    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
    LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/login/'
    ```

## Step 2: Adapt the Flet App to Receive Django's `request`

Modify your Flet code so its `main` function can accept the Django `request` object. This is the key to integration.

```python
# tsa_app/flet_app.py
# (This is your existing Flet code, with modifications to the `main` function)

import flet as ft
# ... (all your Section, Card, and content builder functions go here) ...

# ADAPTED Main Flet App Class
class TSAApp:
    def __init__(self, page: ft.Page, request):
        self.page = page
        self.request = request  # Store the Django request object
        self.user = request.user # You now have direct access to the logged-in user!
        
        # ... the rest of your __init__ logic from the Flet app ...
        # (setting up views, nav bars, etc.)

    # ... (all other methods of your TSAApp class) ...

# THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT FOR FLET-DJANGO
def main(page: ft.Page):
    # Get the Django request object passed by FletView
    # FletView stores it in page.session
    dj_request = page.session.get("django_request")
    
    # Now you can check if the user is authenticated and what their role is
    if dj_request.user.is_authenticated:
        # You can add logic here to differentiate between officers and students
        # For example, by checking if they are a superuser or belong to a group
        is_officer = dj_request.user.is_superuser
        
        # Initialize your app, passing the user info
        app = TSAApp(page, dj_request, is_officer) # Pass the officer status to your app
        app.build_ui() # Build the initial UI
    else:
        # If for some reason an unauthenticated user reaches this, show an error.
        page.add(ft.Text("Authentication Error. Please log in."))

```
*Note: The routing logic inside your Flet app (`page.go()`) will work perfectly within this structure.*

## Step 3: Create the Django Views

You will need two types of views:
1.  A standard Django view for the login page.
2.  The `FletView` to render your Flet application.

```python
# tsa_app/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView
from flet_django.views import FletView
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin

# Import the main function from your Flet app file
from .flet_app import main as flet_main_app

class AppFletView(LoginRequiredMixin, FletView):
    """
    This view renders the main Flet application.
    LoginRequiredMixin ensures only logged-in users can access it.
    """
    def get_flet_app(self):
        # This is the entry point function for your Flet app
        return flet_main_app

    def get_flet_app_kwargs(self):
        # Pass the Django request object to the Flet app via the page session
        return {"django_request": self.request}


class AppLoginView(LoginView):
    """
    A standard Django login view.
    """
    template_name = 'tsa_app/login.html'
```

## Step 4: Create the Login Template

Since we are using Django's authentication, the login page is a standard HTML template.

Create a `templates/tsa_app` directory inside your `tsa_app` folder.

```html
<!-- tsa_app/templates/tsa_app/login.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>TSA Club Portal Login</title>
    <style>
        /* Add some basic styling */
        body { font-family: sans-serif; display: grid; place-content: center; height: 100vh; margin: 0; background-color: #f0f2f5; }
        form { background: white; padding: 40px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); width: 300px; }
        input { width: 100%; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px; box-sizing: border-box; }
        button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; border: none; background-color: #007bff; color: white; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; }
        h2 { text-align: center; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <form method="post">
        <h2>TSA Club Portal</h2>
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 5: Configure the URLs

Finally, wire everything up in your URL configuration.

1.  **Create `tsa_app/urls.py`**:

    ```python
    # tsa_app/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from django.contrib.auth.views import LogoutView
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        # The login page, using our custom view
        path('login/', views.AppLoginView.as_view(), name='login'),

        # The Django logout view
        path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),

        # The main Flet application view. This MUST be the last pattern
        # to catch all other routes for the Flet router.
        path('<path:route>', views.AppFletView.as_view(), name='flet_app_route'),
        path('', views.AppFletView.as_view(), name='flet_app'),
    ]
    ```

2.  **Include these URLs in the main `tsa_project/urls.py`**:

    ```python
    # tsa_project/urls.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', include('tsa_app.urls')), # Include your app's URLs
    ]
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Create Users**:
    First, you need users in your database. Run the migrations and create a superuser (who will be an officer) and a regular user (who will be a student).
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    # Follow prompts to create an officer user

    # To create a student, use the admin panel or the shell
    python manage.py shell
    >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    >>> User.objects.create_user('student1', 'student1@email.com', 'password123')
    ```

2.  **Run the Django Server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3.  **Access the App**:
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
    *   You will be redirected to the Django login page.
    *   Log in as the "officer" or "student" you created.
    *   Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the main Flet application, which will now render the correct view (Officer or Student) based on the user you logged in as.

## Handling Modals (Saving Data)

Your modals for "Add Announcement" etc., now need to send data back to Django. The simplest way to do this *within* the `flet-django` architecture is to create a few dedicated API endpoints for these "write" actions.

You would create a simple view in `tsa_app/views.py` and a corresponding URL, and then use the `requests` library in your Flet `save_and_close` function to `POST` the data, just as described in the previous REST API guide. This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: tight auth/data integration on page load, and simple, stateless actions for saving data.
